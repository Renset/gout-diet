        People with gout and hyperuricemia should control the level of purines
        in the food to prevent gout attacks and other complications. Below you
        will find purine and uric acid levels for different kinds of food. Even
        for people without gout and hyperuricemia, the daily recommended limit
        is 400 mg of purines.
